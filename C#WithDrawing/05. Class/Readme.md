# ICar vs IMovable + IRenderable

## 1. Design Perspective Differences

| Category | ICar-based Design | IMovable + IRenderable-based Design |
|---|---|---|
| Responsibility Separation | A single interface contains multiple roles | Movement and rendering are separated into interfaces |
| Concern Focus | Concrete domain centered on "car" | Capability (behavior) oriented design |
| Application Scope | Suitable for car-related objects | Applicable to various types of objects |
| Code Dependency | Strongly dependent on domain | Loosely coupled by functional units |

## 2. Interface Structure Comparison

ICar approach
```csharp
interface ICar
{
    Image Image { get; }
    Point Position { get; }
    void Move();
}
```
- Contains both movement and rendering functions in a single interface
- Bound to a concrete concept of a car

IMovable + IRenderable approach
```csharp
public interface IMovable { void Move(); }
public interface IRenderable { Image Image { get; } Point Location { get; } }
```
- Movement and rendering functionalities are separated
- Flexible combinations are possible

## 3. SOLID Principle Perspective

| Principle | ICar | IMovable + IRenderable |
|---|---|---|
| SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) | Mixed roles may violate the principle | Each interface has a separated responsibility |
| ISP (Interface Segregation Principle) | May force implementation of unwanted members | Only required members are implemented |
| OCP (Open/Closed Principle) | Modifications might be required for extension | Extensible without modification |
| DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle) | Domain-centered dependency | Dependency on abstract capabilities |

## 4. Applicable Scope

| Category | ICar | IMovable + IRenderable |
|---|---|---|
| Car-exclusive design | Suitable | Excessive |
| Game engine architecture | Not suitable | Suitable |
| UI element representation | Limited | Possible |
| Introducing diverse objects | Difficult | Easy |

## 5. Advantages Comparison

Advantages of the ICar approach:
- Simple code structure
- Easy to understand in car-centric domain programs
- One interface keeps relationships simple

Advantages of the IMovable + IRenderable approach:
- High reusability
- Freely design movable/renderable objects
- High maintainability
- Easy to test
- Separation of responsibilities reduces ripple effects caused by changes

## 6. Disadvantages Comparison

Disadvantages of the ICar approach:
- Movement and rendering are not separated
- Difficult to introduce non-car objects
- Interface modifications may be required for extension
- Concerns are coupled

Disadvantages of the IMovable + IRenderable approach:
- Increased number of interfaces
- Initial structure may look complex
- Design time slightly increases

## 7. Realistic Analogy

ICar:
- A structure that forces fixed roles suitable only for cars

IMovable / IRenderable:
- "Ability components" that can be attached as needed, similar to component-based designs used in game engines

## 8. Recommended Situations

ICar recommended when:
- The scope is small and only cars are handled
- No expansion requirements, development speed is prioritized

IMovable + IRenderable recommended when:
- Many types of objects must be handled
- Game development, UI rendering, animation systems
- Strong maintainability is required

## 9. Summary Table

| Feature Comparison | ICar | IMovable + IRenderable |
|---|---|---|
| Simplicity | High | Medium |
| Extensibility | Low | High |
| Reusability | Low | High |
| Testability | Medium | High |
| Responsibility Separation | Low | High |
| Domain Dependency | High | Low |

## 10. Conclusion

The ICar approach is efficient in simple, car-centric examples.
However, since movement and rendering concerns are not separated, it suffers from low extensibility and maintainability in systems that must handle diverse types of objects.
-> Adding flyingcar or marinecar would be possible.

The IMovable + IRenderable approach offers advantages in responsibility separation, reusability, and extensibility, and provides structural benefits in systems where various objects coexist.
-> You can add truck instead of only car, etc.
